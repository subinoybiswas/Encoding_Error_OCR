# Optical Handwritten Character Recognition
## About
In our model for text recognition, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to recognize the characters. We used a Kaggle Dataset to train our model and created a notebook that has all the necessary parts to run this program.

Utilizing the power of deep learning, we can use libraries like Keras, Tensorflow, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Pandas, to build an algorithm that helps us in easing optical character recognition.
## Why this solution was used?
Traditional Data Collection methods like manually transferring Hard Copies of Data to a Digital Database are tedious, time-consuming, and repetitive. To solve this issue we implemented this solution.

### Pre-requisities
We need to set up a few things before we can run this project. We need to install these packages to use this code on our systems.
'pip install imutils'
'pip install tensorflow'
'pip install seaborn'
'pip install sklearn'
'pip install keras'
